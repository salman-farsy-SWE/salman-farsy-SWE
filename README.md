## Hi there 👋

**My name is Salman Farsy. I like to write code and collaborate with people.

Here is some of my knowledge that I learned from these lessons.

- I learned how to create a repo, then create a branch in that repo.
- I learned how to update and add a new file, then commit the changes.
- I learned how to pull a branch and merge the branch into the main.
- It was an amazing lesson for me. Working with GitHub feels very premium.
